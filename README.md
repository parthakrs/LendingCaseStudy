## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- The project involves analyzing data from a lending platform, possibly Lending Club, to derive insights,
- Lending Club faces a critical challenge in minimizing credit losses stemming from loans to "risky" applicants.The objective is twofold: identifying applicants likely to repay for profitability while avoiding substantial financial losses associated with approving loans for those at risk of default. 

- The primary focus is on making sound decisions in the loan approval process to strike a balance between generating profits through interest payments and preventing potential business loss by rejecting creditworthy applicants.
- The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Factors for predicting defaulting  
    - DTI  being higher-
    - Lesser Annual income
    - Longer term(60 month)
    - Public record of Bankruptcies is higher
    - Home status  Mortgage or rent
    - High Interest Rate
    - Grade
- Other factor should be enforced
    - Enforce verification process for loan approval process. 20% loans are not verified.
    - Borrower with higher grade is risky as their interest rate is higher
    - Borrower  with 10+  year experience , having higher risk than others.
